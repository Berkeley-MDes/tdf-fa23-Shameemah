# Project 1 Pre-Project Exploration: A Cell Phone Stand - 08/24/2023 to 08/31/2023
## Reflections ##

This week, I spent some time playing around with the Rhino and Grasshopper files provided for the pre-project exploration, in order to understand the different facets, and how the 2 work together. The class was given a worked example of computational design for a cell phone stand. After some time of tinkering with these files, and the Rhino and Grasshopper interfaces, I managed to find the different phone size metrics in the grasshoper file, and changed the values in the sliders to see how it impacted the phone stand model. 

Following this, I measured my phone length, width, and thickness, and went ahead to modify the values in grasshoper to match my measurements, with the assumption that this would generate a phone stand that fits my phone.

Initially, I experienced some difficulty with exporting the Rhino file to Adobe Illustrator; the exported file was blank. However, after some troubleshooting and some help from TJ, I learned that this issue was due to the origin of the drawings being offset way off the page. After modifying the 'Move Off Mode' value in Grasshopper, I was able to export my file successfully and prepare my file for laser cutting!

The computer systems in the Jacobs Hall Makerspace were reset recently, so the laser cutting settings were a little off. I had to tinker with various settings, and make multiple test cuts in order to finally get the laser to cut through my piece of wood. With some help from Gary and Sudhu, I was able to make the cut successfully (albeit, with some very burnt edges). However, through this process I came to understand the different factors that impact the laser cutting process. If I had more time, I would have liked to try out different settings in order to get the perfect cut. Nonetheless, I was able to cut successfully, and my phone stand fit my phone perfectly!

### ðŸ’¡ Through this exploration I learned: ###
- how Rhino and grasshopper work together to create parametric and computational models
- some common issues that may arise with exporting a Rhino drawing to Adoble Illustrator, and how to resolve them
- how to prepare a file for laser cutting
- how to use the laser cutter
- the factors that influence the success of a laser cut

## Speculations ##

Given that computational design is a completely new field for me, there is so much to learn! I am curious to learn more about potential applications, and how I can apply this to some of the problems I am interested in solving around accessibility and inclusion. I am also curious to understand the ways in which we can merge computational design with powerful technologies like AI, sensing, and AR/VR.
