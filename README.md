# 09/14/2023 to 09/21/2023: Photon 2 Setup
## Reflections #

This week, I wrapped up project 1 and we're kicking off electronics with the Photon 2! :D We followed a tutorial provided by Professor Sudhu,which explained how to connect the Photon 2 to a Wi-Fi network.

The process was fairly straightforward, and I didn't bump into any hiccups along the way. However, I feel like I'm lacking a basic understanding of circuits, so I'll be spending some time this weekend trying to understand that a little better. 

### ðŸ’¡ Through this exploration I learned: ###
- how to connect a Photon 2 microcontroller to a Wi-Fi network 

## Speculations ##

Honestly not quite sure what to think yet because this is a whole new world for me. I'll hve more to say once I get a better hang of what this technology is capable of.

# 09/07/2023 to 09/14/2023: Project 1 - Parametric Slow Feeder
## Reflections ##

For project 1, I chose to challenge myself to create a parametric slow feeder from scratch. A slow feeder is a bowl with ridges that make it harder for pets to eat quickly. I have a 4lb toy poodle who eats incredibly fast, which has led to health issues in the past. Due to her small size, it's very difficult to find a slow feeder that is small but also intense enough to slow her feeding down drastically. This project gave me the perfect opportunity to try and tackle this issue myself.  

The video below provides a 3 minute summary on the problem I chose to tackle, solution developed, and potential advancements for the future.

This was a very fun project for me that allowed me to get a good grasp of grasshopper and rhino, but also develop the system thinking skills that go into parametric and computational design.

### ðŸ’¡ Through this exploration I learned: ###
- how to create a parametric model using Grasshoper and Rhino
- how to create a quick video using Adobe Premiere Rush
- system thinking 

## Speculations ##

As an advancement to this project, I am interested in understanding how Machine Learning can make this solution smarter. For example, is it possible to train a model to be able to predict the perfect bowl size and slow feeder intensity for a pet based on their breed and weight?

I also intend on iterating on this project by providing users with the option to select different patterns for the ridges in the bowl. Lastly, I intend on 3D printing the bowl and testing it on my dog to see if it effectively slows down her eating. 


# 08/31/2023 to 09/07/2023: Project 1 Pre-Project Exploration - Self-Guided Study
## Reflections ##

This week, my focus was on understanding the basics of Grasshopper and how it interacts with Rhino. Through last week's exploration, it was clear to me that I needed to understand Grasshopper at a foundational level before I could deep dive into the worked example provided. In order to do this, I registered for a [Udemy course that covers Parametric Design with Grasshopper from beginner to advanced levels](https://www.udemy.com/course/parametric-design-with-grasshopper-full-beginner-to-advanced/).

So far, I have found this course incredibly beneficial. Though I am still in the beginner level of the course, I now have a better understanding of some basic Grasshopper components, the relationship between Grasshopper and Rhino, and how to make very simple parametric designs using various inputs. 

### ðŸ’¡ Through this exploration I learned: ###
- various Grasshopper components such as points, lines, curves, vectors, panels, etc., and how they work
- how to transform geometries using move, rotation, mirror, etc.
- how to link an existing Rhino model to a Grasshopper component
- how to make a model in Grasshopper available in Rhino using 'bake'
- how to make a model parametric using inputs such as the number slider, panel, md slider, etc. 

## Speculations ##

By the end of this Udemy crash course, I hope to have gained enough knowledge to be able to make a more advanced parametric model, and perhaps create my own version of the cellphone stand from scratch. I'm still curious to understand where AI can be plugged into this process and what that means for computational design as a whole. 

# 08/24/2023 to 08/31/2023: Project 1 Pre-Project Exploration: A Cell Phone Stand
## Reflections ##

This week, I spent some time playing around with the Rhino and Grasshopper files provided for the pre-project exploration, in order to understand the different facets, and how the 2 work together. The class was given a worked example of computational design for a cell phone stand. After some time of tinkering with these files, and the Rhino and Grasshopper interfaces, I managed to find the different phone size metrics in the grasshoper file, and changed the values in the sliders to see how it impacted the phone stand model. 

Following this, I measured my phone length, width, and thickness, and went ahead to modify the values in grasshoper to match my measurements, with the assumption that this would generate a phone stand that fits my phone.

Initially, I experienced some difficulty with exporting the Rhino file to Adobe Illustrator; the exported file was blank. However, after some troubleshooting and some help from TJ, I learned that this issue was due to the origin of the drawings being offset way off the page. After modifying the 'Move Off Mode' value in Grasshopper, I was able to export my file successfully and prepare my file for laser cutting!

The computer systems in the Jacobs Hall Makerspace were reset recently, so the laser cutting settings were a little off. I had to tinker with various settings, and make multiple test cuts in order to finally get the laser to cut through my piece of wood. With some help from Gary and Sudhu, I was able to make the cut successfully (albeit, with some very burnt edges). However, through this process I came to understand the different factors that impact the laser cutting process. If I had more time, I would have liked to try out different settings in order to get the perfect cut. Nonetheless, I was able to cut successfully, and my phone stand fit my phone perfectly!

### ðŸ’¡ Through this exploration I learned: ###
- how Rhino and grasshopper work together to create parametric and computational models
- some common issues that may arise with exporting a Rhino drawing to Adobe Illustrator, and how to resolve them
- how to prepare a file for laser cutting
- how to use the laser cutter
- the factors that influence the success of a laser cut

## Speculations ##

Given that computational design is a completely new field for me, there is so much to learn! I am curious to learn more about potential applications, and how I can apply this to some of the problems I am interested in solving around accessibility and inclusion. I am also curious to understand the ways in which we can merge computational design with powerful technologies like AI, sensing, and AR/VR.
